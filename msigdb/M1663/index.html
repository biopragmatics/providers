                <p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) controls the development of follicle-enclosed oocytes in the mammalian ovary by interacting with specific receptors located exclusively on granulosa cells. Its biological activity involves stimulation of intercellular communication, intracellular signaling, and up-regulation of steroidogenesis; the entire spectrum of genes regulated by FSH is not yet fully characterized. We have established monoclonal rat FSH-responsive granulosa cell lines that express FSH receptors at 20-fold higher rates than with primary cells, and thus increased the probability of yielding a distinct spectrum of genes modulated by FSH. Using Affymetrix DNA microarrays, we discovered 11 genes not reported earlier to be up-regulated by FSH and 9 genes not reported earlier to be down-regulated by FSH. Modulation of signal transduction associated with G-protein signaling, phosphorylation of proteins, and intracellular-extracellular ion balance was suggested by up-regulation of decay accelerating factor GPI-form precursor (DAF), membrane interacting protein RGS16, protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase), oxidative stress-inducible protein tyrosine phosphatase (OSIPTPase), and down-regulation of rat prostatic acid phosphatase (rPAP), Na+, K+-ATPase, and protein phosphatase 1beta. Elevation in granzyme-like proteins 1 and 3, and natural killer (NK) cell protease 1 (NKP-1) along with reduction in carboxypeptidase E indicates possible FSH-mediated preparation of the cells for apoptosis. Up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factors indicates the ability of FSH to produce angiogenic factors upon their maturation; whereas, reduction in insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP3) indicates its increased potential to promote p53-induced apoptosis. Striking similarities in FSH modulation of gene expression were found in primary cultures of human granulosa cells obtained from IVF patients although these cells expressed only 1% of FSH receptor compared with immortalized rat cells, as indicated by microarray technique, which probably is in the normal range of expression of this receptor in nontransformed cells. These findings should increase our understanding of the mechanism of FSH action in stimulating development of the ovarian follicular cells, of intracellular and intercellular communication, and of increasing the potential of ovarian follicular cells to undergo apoptosis during the process of selection of the dominant follicle.</p>
