                <p>Activated forms of Ras family members are prevalent in many cancers where Ras mutants transduce signals essential for transformation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. As a cancer progression model, we used NIH3T3 cells to explore the mechanism of Ras-induced tumorigenesis. Ras family mutants H-RasV12 and Rit79L strongly induced foci formation, while Rho family mutants RhoA-QL, Rac1-QL and Cdc42-QL were less effective. A comparison of downstream transcriptional targets of Ras and Rho family members using a 26 383 element cDNA microarray revealed that the osteopontin (OPN) gene exhibited the best correlation between magnitude of gene expression change and level of foci formation (r=0.96, P&lt;0.001). In association with H-RasV12- and Rit79L-mediated transformation, foci secreted OPN protein and upregulated the OPN receptor CD44, suggesting the novel initiation of an aberrant OPN-CD44-Rac autocrine pathway. In support of this were the following observations. First, RGD-deficient OPN protein-binding activity was present in H-RasV12-transformed cells but not in control cells, and binding activity was inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Second, foci formation, cell invasion and Rac activity were induced by H-RasV12 and inhibited by the CD44 blocking antibody. Third, foci formation by H-RasV12 was substantially reduced by a short interfering RNA (siRNA) specifically targeting OPN expression for knockdown. Fourth, H-RasV12-mediated transformation was not blocked by the GRGDS peptide, suggesting that OPN effects were not mediated by the integrins. Lastly, OPN knockdown affected the downstream expression of 160 &#39;2nd tier&#39; genes, and at least a subset of these genes appears to be involved in transformation. Indeed, four genes were selected for knockdown, each resulting in a disruption of foci formation and/or invasion. These results underscore the role of aberrant autocrine signaling and transcriptional networking during tumorigenesis.</p>
