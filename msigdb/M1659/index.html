                <p>3-Aminobenzamide (3AB) is an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), an enzyme implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity, which is activated in response to radiation-induced DNA strand breaks. cDNA macroarray membranes containing 1536 clones were used to characterize the gene expression profiles displayed by mouse BALB/3T3 fibroblasts (A31 cell line) in response to ionizing irradiation alone or in combination with 3AB. A31 cells in exponential growth were pre-treated with 3AB 4mM 1h before gamma-irradiation (4Gy), remaining in culture during 6h until harvesting time. A31 cells treated with 3AB alone presented a down-regulation in genes involved in protein processing and cell cycle control, while an up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and related to DNA/RNA synthesis and repair was verified. A31 cells irradiated with 4Gy displayed 41 genes differentially expressed, being detected a down-regulation of genes involved in protein processing and apoptosis, and genes controlling the cell cycle. Concomitantly, another set of genes for protein processing and related to DNA/RNA synthesis and repair were found to be up-regulated. A positive or negative interaction effect between 3AB and radiation was verified for 29 known genes. While the combined treatment induced a synergistic effect on the expression of LCK proto-oncogene and several genes related to protein synthesis/processing, a negative interaction effect was found for the expression of genes related to cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix assembly (SATB1 and Anexin III), cell cycle control (tyrosine kinase), and genes participating in DNA/RNA synthesis and repair (RNA helicase, FLAP endonuclease-1, DNA-3 glycosylase methyladenine, splicing factor SC35 and Soh1). The present data open the possibility to investigate the direct participation of specific genes, or gene products acting in concert in the mechanism underlying the cell response to radiation-induced DNA damage under the influence of PARP inhibitor.</p>
